            <h1>Discord Moderator Guide</h1>

            <p>
                These are guidelines for moderators on the 8 Bits to Infinity Discord server. As a moderator, you
                are expected to understand the powers and uphold the responsibilities outlined in this document.
            </p>

            <h2>Terms</h2>

            <p>
                Whenever "Josh" is mentioned in this guide, it means our community manager and jam host, Retro Indie
                Josh. You can ping or message him @RetroIndieJosh on Discord, tweet or DM on Twitter
                @RetroIndieJosh, or email seciden@gmail.com as a last resort.
            </p>

            <p>
                By "moderator" we include those with the roles Admin or Moderator.
            </p>

            <p>
                By "user" we mean any non-moderator on the server.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Moderator Levels
            </h2>

            <p>
                We have two moderator levels: Community Manager and Moderator. Josh is the only Community Manager.

            <h2>
                Requirements
            </h2>

            <p>
                As a requirement for Discord community security, you must set up two-factor authentication (2FA) on
                your Discord account in order to use any moderator-level powers. This is a good idea for security,
                anyway.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Moderator Powers
            </h2>

            <p>
                As a moderator, you have the power to:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Kick users from the server (removes them but they can rejoin)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ban users from the server (removes them and prevents them from rejoining)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Change a user's display name on the server
                </li>
                <li>
                    View and post in moderator-only channels
                </li>
                <li>
                    Assign roles to and remove roles from users
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add or remove server emojis
                </li>
                <li>
                    Take priority on a voice channel with the Push to Talk (Priority) keybind
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>
                Your Responsibilities
            </h2>

            <h3>
                Know and enforce the rules
            </h3>

            <p>
                Our rules are listed on the #welcome-and-rules channel. Your responsibilities are to:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Know these rules and [our mission](http://8bitstoinfinity.com/index.php?page=Mission)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Understand these rules (ask Josh or another moderator if you have any questions)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Answer any user questions about these rules
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enforce these rules with warnings, kicks, and bans
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>
                Inform Josh of any mistakes
            </h3>

            <p>
                If you spot a mistake or oversights in server documentation, channels, channel descriptions, etc.,
                bring it to Josh's attention as soon as possible so he can fix it.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Encourage server discussion
            </h3>

            <p>
                When a user posts in a discussion channel, it's critical that they receive a response within a
                reasonable time frame. Take initiative to interact if you are able. This helps maintain a supportive
                atmosphere, and also feeds the Discord algorithm for things like server discovery listing.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Keep up-to-date with conversation in #power-core
            </h3>

            <p>
                The #power-core channel is where moderators and administrators can discuss
                happenings on the server. Josh often asks for assistance on this channel with
                any major server changes.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can also discuss whether to warn, kick, or ban a user in this channel if
                Josh is not immediately responding to your concern
            </p>

            <h3>
                Inform Josh of upcoming absences
            </h3>

            <p>
                If you will be inactive in the server for an extended period of time (a month or
                more), please inform Josh and the rest of the team. You don't need to provide a reason, just an
                estimated return time. You are not required to be involved in the server 24/7 but it is important
                that everyone on the team is aware of extended absences.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Respond to @moderator pings
            </h3>

            <p>
                All moderators are notified when a user pings @moderator. Anyone on the server can
                ping this role. If you are unsure how to handle the situation, ping Josh.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Run bot commands in the #mod-bot channel
            </h3>

            <p>
                The #mod-bot channel is for moderators to run bot commands when the output would be
                spammy or reveal sensitive information. Please limit any warnings, kicks, bannings,
                or investigations into a user's history to this channel.
            </p>

            <p>
                When in doubt of which channel to execute a bot command in, as a moderator, you
                should default to #mod-bot just in case.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Warn, kick, or ban users who break the rules
            </h3>

            <p>
                Although some leniency should be allowed for those who have simply misunderstood or failed to read
                the rules, repeated offenses should result in consequences.
            </p>

            <p>
                Whenever you warn a user for breaking a rule, be sure to use the !warn command so we can track how
                many times they have been warned. Supply a message with the !warn command explaining *why* you are
                warning the user, for record-keeping.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, if Josh innocently posts a link to another Discord server because he didn't read the
                rules carefully, remind him to review the #rules channel, then use the command:
            </p>

            <p>
                <code>
                    !warn @RetroIndieJosh Posted a link to a Discord server
                </code>
            </p>

            <p>
                Then, check in the #mod-bot channel to see if this user has previously broken this rule:
            </p>

            <p>
                <code>
                    !warnings @RetroIndieJosh
                </code>
            </p>

            <p>
                With three warnings, kick the user, again with a message explaining why:
            </p>

            <p>
                <code>
                    !kick @RetroIndieJosh Posting Discord links
                </code>
            </p>

            <p>
                With five or more, ban the user, and once more explain why:
            </p>

            <p>
                <code>
                    !kick @RetroIndieJosh Posting Discord links other than 8bits
                </code>
            </p>

            <p>
                For more severe offenses such as clear hostility, hate speech, pornography, illegal material, or
                having a Discord link as their username, issue a ban outright. If you are unsure, contact Josh
                immediately.
            </p>
