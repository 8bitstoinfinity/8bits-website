# Readme

## Directories

the `jam` directory should only contain folders in the format `date_name`

each should contain two files:

- `url.txt` containing a single line with the URL to the jam
- `logo.gif` or `logo.png` containing the logo for the jam

do *not* put additional files in the `jam` directory!

you *may* put files in specific jam directories such as `jam/2022-07_three-button-jam`
