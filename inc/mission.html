    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    <p id='mission-statement'>
        The <em>8 Bits to Infinity</em> mission is to promote game development and game literacy as
        tools for personal improvement and modern education.
    </p>
    <p>
        To meet this mission, we host regular game jams and challenges, in addition to Retro Indie
        Josh producing relevant content on <a href=https://www.twitch.tv/retroindiejosh>Twitch</a> and
        <a href=https://www.youtube.com/@retroindiejosh>YouTube</a>.
    </p>

        <li>
            We can study games as a medium like film or literature to examine themes, craft, and
            commentary on human nature.
        </li>
        <li>
            Interactivity in games adds complexity and intellectual interest, both in the application of
            psychology and the possibility for differences in playthroughs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Game development requires knowledge of psychology, logic, software, hardware, aesthetic,
            storytelling, and many other transferable skills, which can be learned through game
            literacy and strengthened through game development.
        </li>
        <li>
            Games are often developed on teams, requiring additional transferable skills like
            collaboration, organization, and time management.
        </li>
        <li>
            Games synergize several forms of art including visual art, animation, music, sound,
            storytelling, and more, which can be studied individually or as a whole.

    <h2>Community</h2>
    <p>
        Our community stands on four pillars:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Respect</li>
        <li>Inclusion</li>
        <li>Self-Improvement</li>
        <li>Experimentation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Anyone who contributes to our game jams (producing a game, giving feedback, or sharing games
        from the event) or interacts with our content is accepted as a member of our community. We
        require community members to uphold our four pillars.
    </p>
    <h3>Respect</h3>
    <p>
        Treat every other member as you wish to be treated. We have zero tolerance for disrespect or
        discouragement. Respect is simple: Be humble, considerate, helpful, and welcoming. Remember,
        everyone advances at their own pace with their own unique strengths and difficulties.
    </p>
    <h3>Inclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Anyone interested in game development is welcome in our community. Our jams are open to all,
        from a first-timer learning the ropes to a seasooned veteran with years in the industry.
        Our jams benefit all skill levels and, in turn, benefit from a variety of insights,
        perspectives, and backgrounds. Our focus is to help each other learn and grow by examining
        the <em>work</em> and not the developer.
    </p>
    <h3>Self-Improvement</h3>
    <p>
        The most important progress is <em>personal</em> progress. Game development is complex, and
        while many areas benefit from objective feedback on basic skills, creative aspects
        (including the end product) are subjective. Developers should only compare their work to
        their own past work. Each step forward is an accomplishment, regardless of how others
        advance.
    </p>
    <h3>Experimentation</h3>
    <p>
        Experimenting with new tools, technologies, designs, skills, and methods in game development
        is key to advancing skills and finding new ideas. Game development is a cross-discipline
        effort requiring many unrelated skills, so every experiment is an opportunity to learn.
        <em>Fail faster</em>, so you may learn faster.
