        <h2>Jam Rules</h2>
        <p>
                Entries which break these rules or have no clear relation to the
                Limitation will be removed without notification. 
        </p>

        <h3>Main Rules</h3>
        <ul>
                <li>
                        <strong>Solo or Team</strong>: Up to four members, one
                        submission per team. If you're working solo, you count
                        as a team. You may be on multiple teams (although we
                        don't recommend it). All team members and entrants must
                        be 13+ years old.
                </li>
                <li>
                        <strong>Submission</strong>: Answer all questions
                        completely and honestly.
                </li>
                <li>
                        Game Jam: You must create your entry within the duration
                        of the jam. Don't start before the jam begins (except
                        general purpose code as covered below), and the end is a
                        hard deadline.
                </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <ul>
                <li>
                        Must work in Windows 10. Web builds are fine.
                </li>
                <li>
                        Any game-critical text must be in English.
                </li>
                <li>
                        The game cannot require non-standard peripherals for
                        normal play. (The game must implement keyboard and/or
                        mouse controls).
                </li>
        </ul>

                        including CC0 assets and your own work. You may use a
                        handle or team name in place of your real name.
