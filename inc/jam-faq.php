        <h3>
                What tools/engines can/should I use?
        </h3>
        <blockquote>
                Use anything you like! We recommend a proper game engine to save
                time - something like <a href="https://unity.com/"
                target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Unity</a>, <a
                href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="nofollow
                noopener">Godot</a>, <a href="https://defold.com/"
                target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Defold</a>, <a
                href="https://www.unrealengine.com/" target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noopener">Unreal</a>, etc.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
                Not sure what to use? Ask on <a
                href="https://discord.gg/umzMXNq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow
                noopener">Discord</a> or post in this community. We have many
                experienced members familiar with various tools.

        <h3>
                Can I use a framework or library or just code in raw
                C/C++/JavaScript/etc. instead of using an engine?
        </h3>
        <blockquote>
                Simple answer: <strong>yes</strong>. However, benefits to using
                a premade engine include: 1) it’s easier to port to multiple
                platforms (including web), 2) it’s less work on you, and 3)
                you’re less likely to trigger false positives from antivirus
                software, so more people will play your game.

        <h3>
                I’m awful at music/art. How could I ever make a game?
        </h3>

                <?php include "assets.html" ?>

        <h3>
                I don’t know how to program. Can I still make games?
        </h3>
        <blockquote>
                Absolutely! Many systems require minimal programming. The best
                way to learn is to get your feet wet, and a game jam is a
                wonderful no-risk way to try out new tech. You can ask for
                suggestions in this community or on the 8 Bits to Infinity
                Discord.

        <h3>
                Is the theme required?
        </h3>
        <blockquote>
                Not technically, but it <em>is</em> a voting category, so you
                will score higher overall with a strong use of the theme.

        <h3>
                Should I build for Windows/Mac/Linux/web/[insert system here]?
        </h3>
        <blockquote>
                Yes! Build for as many systems as you can so more people can
                play your game. We recommend finding someone with the target
                system to test your build long before the jam ends so you can be
                sure it works.

        <h3>
                I didn’t finish. Should I submit?
        </h3>
        <blockquote>
                Yes! Game jams are about creating prototypes. A finished game
                takes years. You can still win with a cool idea, even if the
                experience is brief.

        <h3>
                How can I get more people to play my entry?
        </h3>
        <blockquote>
                Play games from the jam and on itch.io, leaving quality
                feedback. Ask the dev politely to play your game, so they know
                you’re looking for feedback. There’s also a new feature on
                itch.io that shows your entry when you comment on the game’s jam
                page so be sure to do so there.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
                You can also share your game on the #share-your-work channel of
                our <a href="https://discord.gg/umzMXNq" target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noopener">Discord</a>.

        <h3>
                Can I make a multiplayer game?
        </h3>
        <blockquote>
                Yes, but we don’t recommended it due to the extra difficulty
                both in development and receiving quality feedback in the jam
                time limit.
        </blockquote>

        <h3>
                Can I make a 2D/2.5D/3D game?
        </h3>
        <blockquote>
                Unless the jam limitation strictly limits this, yes.
        </blockquote>

        <h3>
                Can I enter other jams with the same game?
        </h3>
        <blockquote>
                Absolutely, as long as you follow all rules and time limitations
                for each jam. Note we lock submissions, so you won’t be able to
                upload new builds while this jam is being rated.
        </blockquote>

        <h3>
                Where can I ask more questions?
        </h3>
        <blockquote>
                Ask in the current jam's community or on the 8 Bits to Infinity
                <a href="https://discord.gg/umzMXNq" rel="nofollow
                noopener">Discord</a>.
