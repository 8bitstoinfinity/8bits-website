        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>
                <em>8 Bits to Infinity</em> is a community of game developers
                built on four pillars: Respect, Inclusion, Self-Improvement, and
                Experimentation.
        </p>
        <p id='mission-statement'>
                Our mission is to improve the craft and artistry of game
                develpment by hosting game jams focused on honest feedback and
                iterative improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
                We see aanyone who contributes to our game jams (producing a
                game, giving feedback, or sharing games from the event) as a
                member of our community, and strive to uphold each member to the
                standards in this mission statement.
        </p>
        <h3>Respect</h3>
        <p>
                Treat every other member as you wish to be treated. We have zero
                tolerance for disrespect or discouragement. Respect is simple:
                Be humble, considerate, helpful, and welcoming. Remember,
                everyone advances at their own pace with their own unique
                strengths and difficulties.
        </p>
        <h3>Inclusion</h3>
        <p>
                Anyone interested in game development is welcome in our
                community. Our jams are open to all, from a first-timer learning
                the ropes to a seasooned veteran with years in the industry.
                Our jams benefit all skill levels and, in turn, benefit from 
                a variety of insights, perspectives, and backgrounds. Our focus
                is to help each other learn and grow by examining the
                <em>work</em> and not the developer.
        </p>
        <h3>Self-Improvement</h3>
        <p>
                The most important progress is <em>personal</em> progress. Game
                development is complex, and while many areas benefit from
                objective feedback on basic skills, creative aspects (including
                the end product) are subjective. Developers should only compare
                their work to their own past work. Each step forward is an
                accomplishment, regardless of how others advance.
        </p>
        <h3>Experimentation</h3>
        <p>
                Experimenting with new tools, technologies, designs, skills, and methods
                in game development is key to advancing skills and finding new ideas.
                Game development is a cross-discipline effort requiring many unrelated
                skills, so every experiment is an opportunity to learn. <em>Fail
                faster</em>, so you may learn faster.
        </p>
