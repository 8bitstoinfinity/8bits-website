        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>
                <em>8 Bits to Infinity</em> is a community of game developers
                built on four pillars: Respect, Inclusion, Self-Improvement, and
                Experimentation.
        </p>
        <p id='mission-statement'>
                Our mission is to improve the craft and artistry of game
                develpment by hosting game jams focused on honest feedback and
                iterative improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
                Anyone who contributes to our game jams, whether by producing a
                game, giving feedback, and sharing games (i.e. on Twitch or
                YouTube) a member of our community, and strive to uphold each
                member to the standards in this mission statement.
        </p>
        <h3>Respect</h3>
        <p>
                Treat every other member as you wish to be treated. We have zero
                tolerance for disrespecting or discouraging others from learning,
                experimenting, and showcasing their efforts. Respect is easy: Be humble,
                considerate, helpful, and welcoming. Remember that everyone advances at
                their own pace and has their own areas of difficulty.
        </p>
        <h3>Inclusion</h3>
        <p>
                We welcome anyone interested in game development to join our community,
                whether to develop games for our jams or partake in some other way, such
                as providing feedback or showcasing jam games. Anyone can join our jams,
                whether it's their first time in game development or they've been in the
                industry for years. Our jams benefit developers of all skill levels, and
                in turn, all skill levels contribute to the strength of our jams. The
                goal is to help each other learn, to examine the <em>work</em> and not
                the developer.
        </p>
        <h3>Self-Improvement</h3>
        <p>
                The most important progress is <em>personal</em> progress. Game
                development is a complex undertaking, and while many areas fit objective
                feedback on basic skills, creative aspects (including the end product)
                are subjective. Developers must only compare their work to their own
                past work. Each step forward is an accomplishment, regardless of how
                others advance.
        </p>
        <h3>Experimentation</h3>
        <p>
                Experimenting with new tools, technologies, designs, skills, and methods
                in game development is key to advancing skills and finding new ideas.
                Game development is a cross-discipline effort requiring many unrelated
                skills, so every experiment is an opportunity to learn. <em>Fail
                faster</em>, so you may learn faster.
